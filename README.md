### üëã About Me

I'm **Juan Reyes-Ortiz**, an engineer graduated from **CPE Lyon**, with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Image Processing**.  
Curious and self-driven, I enjoy **learning autonomously** through resources like **Udemy**, **DataCamp**, and **YouTube**, constantly exploring new technologies and refining my expertise.  
I combine a strong theoretical background with **hands-on projects**, turning complex algorithms into efficient, user-friendly tools.
